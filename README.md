👋 Hi, I’m KSHV Sai Hari Krishna! I'm an aspiring AI Engineer 🤖 with a passion for building real-world solutions using machine learning. I’m currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Vellore Institute of Technology 🎓 (CGPA: 8.17).

I've gained hands-on experience working on AI/ML projects during internships at INTRAIN TECH and SmartInternz, where I developed models, preprocessed data, and optimized performance. I'm proficient in various libraries and frameworks like Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Pandas, and Matplotlib 🐍📊.

In addition to my technical skills, I'm constantly learning and expanding my knowledge through online courses and certifications. I've completed programs in Enterprise Data Science (IBM) 🏢, Google Cloud Skills Boost ☁️, and AWS Academy Cloud Architecting ☁️.

I'm an active participant in hackathons 🎉 and open-source projects 🌍, always looking for new ways to contribute to the AI community.

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me! 🚀
