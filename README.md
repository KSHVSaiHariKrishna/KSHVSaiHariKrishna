I'm KSHV Sai Hari Krishna, an aspiring AI Engineer with a passion for building real-world solutions using machine learning.  I'm currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Vellore Institute of Technology (CGPA: 8.17).

I have experience working on AI/ML projects during internships at INTRAIN TECH and SmartInternz, where I developed models, preprocessed data, and optimized performance. I'm proficient in various libraries and frameworks like Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

In addition to technical skills, I'm constantly learning and expanding my knowledge through online courses and certifications. I've completed programs in Enterprise Data Science (IBM), Google Cloud Skills Boost, and AWS Academy Cloud Architecting.

I'm an active participant in hackathons and open-source projects, always looking for new ways to contribute to the AI community.
